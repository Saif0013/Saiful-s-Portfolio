Description 

Write a program to calculate Australian taxable income based on the user inputs provided by the user.
Submit for grading to confirm five tests pass.

Input

Five inputs are required
Wages Earned - any wages earned in a financial year.
Interest Earned - any interest earned in the financial year.
Unemployment benefits - any unemployment benefits earned in a financial year,
Relationship status (1 = single or 2 = married)
Taxes withheld (already paid). - not used in this first task, but must still be part of the input.

Constraints 

All inputs to the program when testing will be integers.
You do not need to write code to force the user to input integers, but just assume that only integers will be used when
testing the program.
The calculations provided in this program are only valid for Adjusted Gross Incomes AGI) that are less than $120,000.

Processing

AGI is calculated as the sum of: wages earned + interest earned + any unemployment benefits paid .
Tax deduction is $12,000 for singles and $24,000 for a married couple
Taxable income is calculated as the substraction of: AGI - deduction.
If an invalid input is provided for relationship status it should be set to 1 (single) as a default.
If a taxable income is calculated as a negative value, then it should be set to SO.

Output

PRINT the AGI and supplementary information as demonstrated in the examples below:
Note: there should be exactly one space between the colon and the data displayed for the label on each line
NOTE: Dollar amounts are displayed as integers with comma separators.
HINT: You should use the printf function to achieve this.
