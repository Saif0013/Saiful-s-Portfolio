// Please try to do the following programs to enhance your java skills.


// Question 1

The following results are the number of formal two party preferred votes cast in the 2013 Australian Federal election.

Liberal/National Coalition 6,818,824 formal votes
Australian Labor Party 6,722,277 formal votes

Write a program to calculate and display to screen the total number of formal votes. Use 
variables to store the given data. Try to choose meaningful names for the variables.


(Hint: this is a simple program of adding two numbers only.)


Extend the previous program to calculate and display the percentage of formal votes for 
the Liberal/National Coalition and the percentage for the Australian Labor Party.

(Hint: This can be achieved by dividing each party votes againts total votes and then multiplying with 100.)





// Question 2

a. Write a program that will count down, displaying all the integers between 20 and 0 
inclusive using while loop.
b. Rewrite the same program using for loop




// Question 3

Write a program that checks if an integer variable key, is odd or even. Assign a value to key 
and check different values by running your code multiple times. 
a. If the variable is even and divisible by 4, output to screen the message "even again", 
otherwise output "only even". 
a. If the variable is odd and negative, output to screen the message "negatively odd", 
otherwise output "positively odd".

(Hint: This can be achieved using if else statement or switch case.)



// Question 4

An investment account has the initial balance of $25,000. Write a program that uses a for
loop to determine what the balance after 10 years is if the interest is compounded yearly at 
the rate of 4%?
Also, output the running balance each year by putting a print statement within the loop 
body.

(Hint: This one is a little tricky. Try to do it step by step.)





// Question 5 (Math class problem)


The following program uses equations of motion. However, it is missing some code. 
Write some code to make it function. Write code where you find (// ADD CODE HERE) this line.


public class PhysicsCalc
{
 public static void main(String[] args)
 {
 double time = 3.0;
 double initialVelocity = 4.5;
 double acceleration = 9.5;
 double finalVelocity = 0;
 double displacement = 0;
 
 // Equation 1
 // ADD CODE HERE
 
 System.out.println("Equation 1: " + displacement);
 // Equation 2
 // ADD CODE HERE

 System.out.println("Equation 2: " + displacement);

 // Equation 3
 // ADD CODE HERE

 System.out.println("Equation 3: " + finalVelocity);

// Equation 4
 // ADD CODE HERE

 System.out.println("Equation 4: " + finalVelocity);
 }
}


Please find a screen shot in the email for the equations.




// Question 6

a. Write a program that will store a person's name as a string and display a welcome 
message "Hello [name]" to that person. 

Output: 
Hello William

b. Change the above program so that the string now stores person's full name (their first 
and last name (i.e. Fred Jones)) and the program will display "Jones, F.". Assume single 
word first and last names are entered. (Practice with indexOf, charAt and substring, 
all from the String class) 

Output: 
Jones, F.
