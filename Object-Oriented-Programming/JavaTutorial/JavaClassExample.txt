// Question 1
Write a program to print the area of a rectangle by creating a class named 'Area' having two methods. 
First method named as 'setDim' takes length and breadth of rectangle as parameters and the second method
named as 'getArea' returns the area of the rectangle.
Length and breadth of rectangle are entered through keyboard.


// Question 2
Create a class named 'Student' with String variable 'name' and integer variable 'roll_no'. 
Assign the value of roll_no as '2' and that of name as "John" by creating an object of the class Student.

// Answer:
class Student{
  String name;
  int roll_no;
}

class Ans{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Student s = new Student();
    s.name = "John";
    s.roll_no = 2;
    System.out.println("Name is "+s.name+" and roll number is "+s.roll_no);
  }
}	


// Question 3
Assign and print the roll number,
phone number and address of two students having names "Sam" and "John" respectively
by creating two objects of class 'Student'.



// Question 4
 Write a program to print the area and perimeter of a triangle having sides of
3, 4 and 5 units by creating a class named 'Triangle' without any parameter in its constructor.


// Answer:

class Triangle{
  int a,b,c;
  public double getArea(){
    double s = (a+b+c)/2.0;
    return Math.pow((s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)),.5);
  }
  public double getPerimeter(){
    return (a+b+c)/2.0;
  }
}

class Ans{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Triangle t = new Triangle();
    t.a = 2;
    t.b = 5;
    t.c = 6;
    System.out.println(t.getArea());
    System.out.println(t.getPerimeter());
  }
}



// Question 5
Write a program to print the area and perimeter of a triangle having sides of 3, 4 and 5 units by creating 
a class named 'Triangle' with constructor having the three sides as its parameters.


// Question 6
Write a program to print the area of two rectangles having sides (4,5) and (5,8) respectively by creating 
a class named 'Rectangle' with a method named 'Area' which returns the area and length and breadth passed 
as parameters to its constructor.

// Answer
class Rectangle{
  int length;
  int breadth;
  public Rectangle(int l, int b){
    length = l;
    breadth = b;
  }
  public int getArea(){
    return length*breadth;
  }
  public int getPerimeter(){
    return 2*(length+breadth);
  }
}

class Ans{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Rectangle a = new Rectangle(4,5);
    Rectangle b = new Rectangle(5,8);
    System.out.println("Area : "+a.getArea()+" Perimeter is "+a.getPerimeter());
    System.out.println("Area : "+b.getArea()+" Perimeter is "+b.getPerimeter());
  }
}								



// Question 7
Write a program to print the area of a rectangle by creating a class named 'Area' taking the values 
of its length and breadth as parameters of its constructor and having a method named 
'returnArea' which returns the area of the rectangle. Length and breadth of rectangle are entered through keyboard.


// Answer
import java.util.*;
class Area{
  int length;
  int breadth;
  public Area(int l, int b){
    length = l;
    breadth = b;
  }
  public int getArea(){

    l = s.nextInt();
    System.out.println("Enter breadth");
    b = s.nextInt();

    Area a = new Area(l,b);
    System.out.println("Area : "+a.getArea());
  }
}
