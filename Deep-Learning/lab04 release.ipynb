    "In this exercise we'll take a look at a form of [normalisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(statistics)) and how it can aide the training of neural networks (and other optimisation techniques, for that matter). As mentioned in the lectures, neural networks are most stable when the inputs and outputs have values near zero, with a standard deviation of approximately 1. Let's see what this looks like in practice.\n",

    "We will demonstrate the importance of normalisation using an interesting forecast prediction dataset. In this dataset we will use cartographic variables of small regions of forest (30m x 30m) to predict the type of forecast cover in each region. Example cover types include: spruce/fir (type 1), lodgepole pine (type 2), etc.\n",

You will notice the cartographic variables include things like elevation, aspect, slope, soil types etc. You will notice that the soil type values are much smaller than elevation, aspect, hydrology measurements. This data will need to be normalised, ensuring all input features are **approximately** in the range `[-1,1]`. There are two reasons for normalisation:\n",

    "1. If the average magnitude of one feature is higher than another, then that feature is implicitly more important during early epochs (the model might eventually learn around this and give that feature a lower weight). By normalising, you ensure that each feature is treated equally at all times and the model can choose which features are important.\n",

You must never use any part of the testing set to tune your model, else you are no longer correctly testing generalisation. Thus, we will calculate the mean and standard deviation from only the training set and then apply it to all splits equally.

Since there was 80% rectangles in the test set it got the answer correct 80% of the time. Later the model was able to sometimes predict Squares but still not often enough hence it did not move much higher than 80%. There are so many more examples of rectangles compared to squares so during backprop most of the gradients try to steer the model towards predicting rectangles. \n",
