#  Domain Specific Medicine Dictionary (DSMD)

**DSMD** is an intelligent, ontology-driven application for retrieving structured medicine information, answering factual queries, and measuring semantic similarity between brands. It was developed as part of a Master's thesis and is intended for use in healthcare, education, and intelligent AI systems.

## 📖 About

The **Domain Specific Medicine Dictionary (DSMD)** enables users to:

- Retrieve detailed attributes of medicine brands (type, dosage, strength, etc.)
- Explore alternative medicine brands
- Fetch pharmacological or side-effect descriptions of generics
- Ask fact-based questions and get “Yes” or “No” answers
- Calculate **similarity scores** and **semantic distances** between two brands based on ontology reasoning

---

## 🔍 Key Features

### ✅ Information Retrieval

Query brand names directly or with a specific attribute:

```
A-Care
A-Care, generic name is
```

### ✅ Question Answering

Ask structured true/false questions like:

```
type_of(A-Care, allopathic)
alternative_brand(Xinc OT, Zinoret)
```

### ✅ Similarity Score

Calculate semantic similarity (0 to 1) between two brands:

```
similarity: A-Cal DX, A-Calm
```

### ✅ Distance Score

Get structural/semantic difference between brands:

```
distance: A-Cal DX, A-Calm
```

|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `A-Care`                               | Full information about A-Care     |
| `A-Care, generic name is`              | Shows the generic of A-Care       |
