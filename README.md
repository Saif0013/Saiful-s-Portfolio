## üîç What's Inside

### ‚úÖ Machine Learning
Projects and assignments demonstrating core ML concepts using:
- **Scikit-learn** for supervised/unsupervised learning
- **Pandas** & **NumPy** for data preprocessing and analysis
- Examples: Decision Trees, SVMs, KNN, Regression, Clustering

### ‚úÖ Deep Learning
Mini-projects and experiments using:
- **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **PyTorch**
- Neural networks, CNNs for image data, and basic RNN models

### ‚úÖ Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Assignments and mini apps focused on:
- Tokenization, embeddings, sentiment analysis
- Sequence models and pre-processing text pipelines

### ‚úÖ Object-Oriented Programming (Java)
- Java programs demonstrating classic OOP patterns
- Python projects following solid OOP design (including inheritance, encapsulation, modularization)

### ‚úÖ Data Mining & Feature Engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA)
- Association rule mining and pattern discovery

### ‚úÖ DSMD Prototype (Domain-Specific Medicine Dictionary)
A GUI-based, object-oriented knowledge graph system built in Python, capable of:
- Information retrieval and question answering from medical domain ontologies
- Ontology-based similarity and distance computation
- Tkinter GUI application

##  Purpose of This Repository

This repository has been created to showcase my practical proficiency in:

- **Python (OOP and scripting)**
- **ML libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy
- **DL libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
- **Data-driven reasoning** using ontologies and graph-based models

## üß™ How to Use

Each subfolder is independent and self-contained. You can explore:

- `ML/`, `DL/`, `NLP/` ‚Äî for coursework
- `DSMD/` ‚Äî for thesis-related prototype

Most Python files are `.py` scripts or `.ipynb` notebooks.
