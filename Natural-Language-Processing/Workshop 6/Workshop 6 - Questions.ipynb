    "## Word embeddings\n",
    "When you're dealing with words in text, you end up with tens of thousands of word classes to analyze; one for each word in a vocabulary. Trying to one-hot encode these words is massively inefficient because most values in a one-hot vector will be set to zero. So, the matrix multiplication that happens in between a one-hot input vector and a first, hidden layer will result in mostly zero-valued hidden outputs.\n",

    "<center>\n",
    "<img width=\"800px\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1It4SmMXCO4OAbd6jzIMjjMKMJnGOEEO0\">\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem and greatly increase the efficiency of our networks, we use what are called embeddings. Embeddings are just a fully connected layer (full matrix). We call this layer the embedding layer and the weights are embedding weights. We skip the multiplication into the embedding layer by instead directly grabbing the hidden layer values from the weight matrix. We can do this because the multiplication of a one-hot encoded vector with a matrix returns the row of the matrix corresponding the index of the \"on\" input unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of doing the matrix multiplication, we use the weight matrix as a lookup table. We encode the words as integers, for example \"heart\" is encoded as 958, \"mind\" as 18094. Then to get hidden layer values for \"heart\", you just take the 958th row of the embedding matrix. This process is called an embedding lookup and the number of hidden units is the embedding dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is nothing magical going on here. The embedding lookup table is just a weight matrix. The embedding layer is just a hidden layer. The lookup is just a shortcut for the matrix multiplication. The lookup table is trained just like any weight matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings aren't only used for words of course. You can use them for any model where you have a massive number of classes. A particular type of model called Word2Vec uses the embedding layer to find vector representations of words that contain semantic meaning."

    "their reduced counterparts. In this case, by *maximum infomation* we mean that the\n",
    "Euclidean distance between the original vectors and their projected siblings is\n",
    "minimal. Hence vectors that were originally close in the embeddings dictionary,\n",
    "will produce lower dimensional vectors that are still close to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see that when you map out the words, similar words will be clustered\n",

    "emotion and are supposed to be near each other when plotted.\n",
    "The words: 'oil', 'gas', and 'petroleum' all describe natural resources.\n",
    "Words like 'city', 'village', 'town' could be seen as synonyms and describe a\n",
    "similar thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before plotting the words, you need to first be able to reduce each word vector\n",
    "with PCA into 2 dimensions and then plot it. The steps to compute PCA are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mean normalize the data\n",
    "2. Compute the covariance matrix of your data ($\\Sigma$).\n",
    "3. Compute the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of your covariance matrix\n",
